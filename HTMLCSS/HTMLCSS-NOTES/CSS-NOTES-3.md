### An Id Selector

You can use the `id` selector to target a specific `div` element. An id selector is defined by a name with a hash symbol directly in front of it, like this:

The `#*id*` selector styles the element with the specified id.

```css
#firstname {
  width: 250px;
}
```

### Max-width

The max-width property in CSS is **used to define the maximum width of an element**. The value of the width cannot be larger than the value by max-width. If the content is larger than the max-width then it will go to the next line and if the content is smaller than the max-width then it has no effect

```css
max-width: 500px;
```

### Fallback value

In CSS, fallbacks are **used to ensure that the design and layout of a website or application are still usable and readable even if some CSS properties are not supported by a browser**. For example, if a browser does not support a certain font or color, a fallback font or color can be used instead.

```css
    h1,h2{font-family: Impact, serif;}
```
