### CSS `linear-gradient` function

he CSS `linear-gradient` function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the `linear-gradient` function actually creates an `image` element, and is usually paired with the `background` property which can accept an image as a value.
