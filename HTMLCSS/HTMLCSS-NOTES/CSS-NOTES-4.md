### Viewpoint Height

The vh unit in CSS measure the “viewport height”. The viewport is **the area of the browser in which a website is displayed**. The vh unit allows you to easily measure the height of the viewport and size elements in relation to this visible area.

```css
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}
```



### REM unit

In CSS rem stands for “root em”, a unit of measurement that represents the font size of the root element. This means that `1rem` equals the font size of the `html` element, which for most browsers has a default value of 16px. Using rem can help ensure consistency of font size and spacing throughout your UI.

According to the [W3C spec](https://www.w3.org/TR/2013/CR-css3-values-20130730/#font-relative-lengths) the definition for one rem unit is:

> Equal to the computed value of `font-size` on the root element. When specified on the `font-size` property of the root element, the rem units refer to the property’s initial value.
