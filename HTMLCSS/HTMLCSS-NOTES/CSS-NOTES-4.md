### CSS `linear-gradient` function

he CSS `linear-gradient` function lets you control the direction of the transition along a line, and which colors are used.

One thing to remember is that the `linear-gradient` function actually creates an `image` element, and is usually paired with the `background` property which can accept an image as a value.

`gradientDirection` is the direction of the line used for the transition. `color1` and `color2` are color arguments, which are the colors that will be used in the transition itself. These can be any type of color, including color keywords, hex, `rgb`, or `hsl`.

```css
background-color: linear-gradient(gradientDirection, color1, color2, ...);
```
