The vh unit in CSS measure the “viewport height”. The viewport is **the area of the browser in which a website is displayed**. The vh unit allows you to easily measure the height of the viewport and size elements in relation to this visible area.

```css
body {
  width: 100%;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
