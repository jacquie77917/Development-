Step 1: 
Configure Git: Once Git is installed, you'll need to configure your name and email address. This information will be used for your Git commits. Replace "Your Name" with your actual name and "your.email@example.com" with your email address:

git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"

Step 2: 
Verify Configuration: You can verify that your configuration was set correctly by checking:


git config --global user.name
git config --global user.email

Step 3: 
To list the files and directories in the current directory using the Mac Terminal, you can use the ls command. Here's how you can do it:

ls

Step 4: 
To navigate to the desired directory, enter cd Dev (the first three letters of the folder) and press the Tab key. This will automatically complete the directory name if there are no other similar directories

Step 5: 
To open the current directory in the Mac Terminal using the default file explorer (Finder), you can use the open command followed by a dot (.) to refer to the current directory. Here's how you can do it:

open .
